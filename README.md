# Unified Architecture for JavaScript applications
##### Guidelines, Recommendations and Best Practices by Philosophie and PWC


The purpose of this project is to offer guidelines for a unified approach in
architecting and developing scalabale JavaScript applications.

There are many ways to arhitect an appliation as well as to implement a feature
in particular. It is important that as a team we decide on particular structures
and patterns to unify and standardize development across teams. In an effort to improve:

- efficiency and productivity team wide
- product and team scalability
- code base shareability
- code reusability
- code quality
- compliance with industry standards

This project aims to achieve compatibility between projects and teams through
four high level goals:

## Recommended Architectural Structure

- **TODO[!]: create architectural anatomy map**
- **TODO[!]: create brief terminology reference for map**
- **TODO[!]: create example boiler plate project for recommended folder structure (also used for style guide)**




## Code Style Guide

- **TODO[!]: create quick ES6 cheat sheet**
- **TODO[!]: create example boiler plate project with component templates (Service, View, etc)**
- TODO: example projects may be created in as many stack versions as needed (react, react-native, angular, etc)
- **TODO[!]: research and recommend linters for ES6/7**




## Documentation Requirements

- **TODO[!]: recommendations on documenting project setup**
- **TODO[!]: recommendations on documenting work-flow (running, debugging, building, releasing)**
- **TODO[!]: recommendations on documenting infrastructure involved**
- **TODO[!]: recommendations on documenting development environment and tools**
- **TODO[!]: recommendations on documenting known issues**




## Shared Code Space

- TODO: guidelines on source repositories for shared modules
- TODO: guidelines on publishing packages and plugins as shared modules
