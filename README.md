# Unified Architecture for JavaScript applications
##### Guidelines, Recommendations and Best Practices by Philosophie and PWC


The purpose of this project is to offer a guideline for a unified approach in
architecting and developing scalabale JavaScript applications.

There are many way to arhitect an appliation as well as to implement a feature
in particular. It is important that as a team we decide on particular structures
and patterns to unify and standardize development across teams. in an effort to improve:

- efficiency and productivity team wide
- product and team scalability
- code base shareability
- code reusability
- code quality
- compliance with industry standards

This project aims to achieve compatibility between projects and teams through
four high level goals:

## Recommended Architectural Structure

## Code Style Guide

## Documentation Requirements

## Shared Code Space
